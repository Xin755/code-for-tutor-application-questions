Programming Task #1

A comment at the top of the file introducing how the code works (to a beginner) and why it works (i.e. the intuition).
    The purpose of this code is to take a given list of digits such as [1,2,2,3,4] and output an integer representing the list i.e. 12234. We first set and initialize 
the final number we want as 0 at the start of our program, which we will then progressively add to it in order to reach the desired output. In basic mathematics, how would we get
to the number 12234 just by using the digits 1,2,2,3,4? We multiply the digit in the first column by 10^4 because it is in the '10 thousands column', the digit in the second column
by 10^3 because it is in the 'thousands column' and so forth until we multiply the digit in the last column by 10^0 which is 1. By basic arithmetic, the resulting number after adding
up all these products together will equal 12234(the number that we want). We can use this method for any given list of digits to get an integer representing these digits. 
Eg: from [1,2,2,3,4] to 12234 or from [1,3,6,7,4,4,0] to 1367440.

# Assign the list of digits to a variable num_list
num_list = [1,2,2,3,4]

# Initialise the final number as 0, which we will then add to it as the program progresses
final_number = 0

# Initialise a variable i as 0 (this variable will help us when executing a for loop in the later stages) 
i = 0
for number in num_list:
    multiplier = len(num_list) - (i+1)
    final_number += (number * 10 ** multiplier)
    i+=1

print(final_number)




    
    
        
            continue
        if higher_lower(player_guess) == "finished":
            guessing = "no"
    conclusion()

main()
